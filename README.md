# Progress-Steps

Create a progress line, much like you'd see in an ecommerce shopping cart experience. 

A click will move the progress bar along, to show that the user is completing steps. 

In this case we'll have 4 steps to complete. On click of next, progress will move ahead one. 

We'll disable the buttons if you cannot go back, or forward , for user experience.
